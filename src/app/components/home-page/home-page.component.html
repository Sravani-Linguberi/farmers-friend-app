        Agriculture is the science, art and practice of cultivating plants and
        livestock.Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary
        human civilization, whereby farming of domesticated species created food
        surpluses that enabled people to live in cities. The history of
        agriculture began thousands of years ago. After gathering wild grains
        beginning at least 105,000 years ago, nascent farmers began to plant
        them around 11,500 years ago. Pigs, sheep, and cattle were domesticated
        over 10,000 years ago. Plants were independently cultivated in at least
        11 regions of the world. Industrial agriculture based on large-scale
        monoculture in the twentieth century came to dominate agricultural
        output, though about 2 billion people still depended on subsistence
        agriculture.
        Modern agronomy, plant breeding, agrochemicals such as pesticides and
        fertilizers, and technological developments have sharply increased crop
        yields, while causing widespread ecological and environmental damage.
        Selective breeding and modern practices in animal husbandry have
        similarly increased the output of meat, but have raised concerns about
        animal welfare and environmental damage. Environmental issues include
        contributions to global warming, depletion of aquifers, deforestation,
        antibiotic resistance, and growth hormones in industrial meat
        production. Agriculture is also very sensitive to environmental
        degradation, such as biodiversity loss, desertification, soil
        degradation and global warming, which cause decrease in crop
        yield.Genetically modified organisms are widely used, although some are
        banned in certain countries.

        The development of agriculture enabled the human population to grow many
        times larger than could be sustained by hunting and gathering.
        Agriculture began independently in different parts of the globe, and
        included a diverse range of taxa, in at least 11 separate centres of
        origin. Wild grains were collected and eaten from at least 105,000 years
        ago.From around 11,500 years ago, the eight Neolithic founder crops,
        emmer and einkorn wheat, hulled barley, peas, lentils, bitter vetch,
        chick peas and flax were cultivated in the Levant. Rice was domesticated
        in China between 11,500 and 6,200 BC with the earliest known cultivation
        from 5,700 BC, followed by mung, soy and azuki beans. Sheep were
        domesticated in Mesopotamia between 13,000 and 11,000 years ago.
        Cattle were domesticated from the wild aurochs in the areas of modern
        Turkey and Pakistan some 10,500 years ago.Pig production emerged in
        Eurasia, including Europe, East Asia and Southwest Asia, where wild boar
        were first domesticated about 10,500 years ago.In the Andes of South
        America, the potato was domesticated between 10,000 and 7,000 years ago,
        along with beans, coca, llamas, alpacas, and guinea pigs. Sugarcane and
        some root vegetables were domesticated in New Guinea around 9,000 years
        ago. Sorghum was domesticated in the Sahel region of Africa by 7,000
        years ago. Cotton was domesticated in Peru by 5,600 years ago,and was
        independently domesticated in Eurasia. In Mesoamerica, wild teosinte was
        bred into maize by 6,000 years ago. Scholars have offered multiple
        hypotheses to explain the historical origins of agriculture. Studies of
        the transition from hunter-gatherer to agricultural societies indicate
        an initial period of intensification and increasing sedentism; examples
        are the Natufian culture in the Levant, and the Early Chinese Neolithic
        in China. Then, wild stands that had previously been harvested started
        to be planted, and gradually came to be domesticated.

      <h1>Contemporary agriculture</h1>
      <hr />
      <p>
        From the twentieth century, intensive agriculture increased
        productivity. It substituted synthetic fertilizers and pesticides for
        labor, but caused increased water pollution, and often involved farm
        subsidies. In recent years there has been a backlash against the
        environmental effects of conventional agriculture, resulting in the
        organic, regenerative, and sustainable agriculture movements. One of the
        major forces behind this movement has been the European Union, which
        first certified organic food in 1991 and began reform of its Common
        Agricultural Policy (CAP) in 2005 to phase out commodity-linked farm
        subsidies, also known as decoupling. The growth of organic farming has
        renewed research in alternative technologies such as integrated pest
        management, selective breeding,[84] and controlled-environment
        agriculture.Recent mainstream technological developments include
        genetically modified food. Demand for non-food biofuel crops,
        development of former farm lands, rising transportation costs, climate
        change, growing consumer demand in China and India, and population
        growth, are threatening food security in many parts of the world.
        The International Fund for Agricultural Development posits that an
        increase in smallholder agriculture may be part of the solution to
        concerns about food prices and overall food security, given the
        favorable experience of Vietnam.[95] Soil degradation and diseases such
        as stem rust are major concerns globally;[96] approximately 40% of the
        world's agricultural land is seriously degraded.[97][98] By 2015, the
        agricultural output of China was the largest in the world, followed by
        the European Union, India and the United States.[81] Economists measure
        the total factor productivity of agriculture and by this measure
        agriculture in the United States is roughly 1.7 times more productive
        than it was in 1948.

            The agriculture sector is undergoing what is called a digital
            revolution, and it’s all around our ability to grow more crops,
            essentially worldwide, to feed a growing population. We have to
            manage every square foot of field a little bit differently than we
            have been.
